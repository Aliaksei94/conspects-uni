\section{MPC}
Formulation of control problem
\begin{equation*}
\left \{
  \begin{tabular}{c}
  $\dot x = f(x,u)$ \\
  $x(0) = x_0$ \\
  $y = h(x)$
  \end{tabular}
  \right. 
\end{equation*}
Objective of MPC: Find stabilizing control strategy that:
\begin{itemize}
\item minimize objective function: $J = \int_{t}^{\infty}F(x(\tau),u(\tau))d\tau$
\item satisfies constraints:
$u(\tau) \in U ,\  x(\tau) \in X$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Closed-loop optimal control vs Open-loop optimal control}
\newline

Closed-loop: Feedback $u=k(x)$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item + Feedback present
\item + suit for uncertainty disturbances
\item - Finding closed solution hardly possible
\end{itemize}

Open-loop optimal control: Input trajectory $u = u(t, x_0)$
\begin{itemize}
\item + Computation often feasible
\item - No feedback
\item - Don't know much about system
\end{itemize}

MPC - repeated open-loop optimal control in feedback fashion.
